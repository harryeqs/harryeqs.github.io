Hi there! I'm Qianshuo (Harry) Ye (Chinese: 叶千硕), a fourth-year Information and Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Cambridge.  

I am currently working with [Professor Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/home) at the [Machine Intelligence Laboratory](https://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge University Engineering Department, on my Master of Engineering project in multimodal artificial intelligence.

# Research Interests
I am broadly interested in **artificial intelligence**, with a particular focus on **multimodal perception and representation learning.** My current work explores how integrating information across modalities can lead to more **robust understanding and reasoning** of vision language models. I am also curious about **computational neuroscience**, particularly how insights from the brain can inspire new architectures for learning and memory. Beyond these, I am also intrigued by **embodied AI** and the development of models with **abstract reasoning capabilities**.

# Beyond Research
I am a music lover and enjoy a wide range of genres, from classical to jazz and rock. I play the cello and bass guitar, and occasionally dabble with the guitar. Outside of music, I also enjoy hiking and experimenting in the kitchen.
