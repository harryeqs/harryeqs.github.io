Hi there! I'm Qianshuo (Harry), a fourth-year Information and Computer Engineering student at the University of Cambridge.  
My Chinese name is 叶千硕 (Ye, Qianshuo): 叶 (Yè) means *leaf*, 千 (Qiān) means *thousand*, and 硕 (Shuò) means *large*.  

I am currently working with [Professor Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/home) at Cambridge on my Master of Engineering project.

## Research Interests
I am passionate about artificial intelligence, with a particular focus on **multimodal perception and representation learning**. My current research explores how models can integrate information across different modalities to enable more **robust understanding and reasoning**.
