Hi there! I'm Qianshuo (Harry), a fourth-year Information and Computer Engineering undergraduate at the University of Cambridge.  

My Chinese name is 叶千硕 (Ye, Qianshuo): 叶 (Yè) means *leaf*, 千 (Qiān) means *thousand*, and 硕 (Shuò) means *large*.  

I am currently working with [Professor Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/home) at Cambridge on my Master of Engineering project on multimodal artificial intelligence.

# Research Interests
I am broadly interested in **artificial intelligence**, with a particular focus on **multimodal perception and representation learning.** My current work explores how integrating information across modalities can lead to more **robust understanding and reasoning** of vision language models. Beyond this, I am also intrigued by **embodied AI** and the development of models with **abstract reasoning capabilities**.

# Beyond Research
I am a music lover and enjoy a wide range of genres, from classical to jazz and rock. I play the cello and bass guitar, and occasionally dabble with the guitar. Outside of music, I also enjoy hiking and experimenting in the kitchen.
